# tinyphf

An extremely stripped down version of rust-phf, just contains the core Map and the codegen Map to generate
it (And done this way mostly so I could understand how the codegen glue works, which is arguably very
straightforward).

## Notes

Can just allow a hash function to be specified in order to allow other folks to use this but that would require I polish
this up a bit more first.
